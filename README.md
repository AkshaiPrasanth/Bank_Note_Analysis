# **BANK_NOTE _ANALYSIS**

The project involved collecting images of both genuine and counterfeit banknotes and using an industrial camera typically used for print inspection to digitize them. The resulting images were 400x400 pixels in size and had a resolution of around 660 dpi due to the camera lens and distance from the subject. Features were then extracted from the images using a Wavelet Transform tool.
